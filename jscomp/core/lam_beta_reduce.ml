(*
   Given an [map], rewrite all let bound variables into new variables, 
   note that the [map] is changed
   example    
   {[
     let a/112 = 3 in a/112      
   ]}
   would be converted into 
   {[
     let a/113 = 3 in a/113     
   ]}   

   ATTENTION: [let] bound idents have to be renamed, 
   Note we rely on an invariant that parameter could not be rebound 
 *)

(* 
  Small function inline heuristics:
  Even if a function is small, it does not mean it is good for inlining,
  for example, in list.ml
   {[
     let rec length_aux len = function
         [] -> len
       | a::l -> length_aux (len + 1) l

     let length l = length_aux 0 l
   ]}   
   if we inline [length], it will expose [length_aux] to the user, first, it make 
   the code not very friendly, also since [length_aux] is used everywhere now, it 
   may affect that we will not do the inlining of [length_aux] in [length]

   Criteior for sure to inline   
   1. small size, does not introduce extra symbols, non-exported and non-recursive   
      non-recursive is required if we re-apply the strategy

   Other Factors:   
   2. number of invoked times
   3. arguments are const or not

(* 
    A naive beta reduce would break the invariants of the optmization.


    The sane but slowest  way:
      when we do a beta reduction, we need rename all variables inlcuding 
      let-bound ones

    A conservative one:
      - for internal one 
        rename params and let bound variables
      - for external one (seriaized)
        if it's enclosed environment should be good enough
        so far, we only inline enclosed lambdas
    TODO: rename 

   Optimizations:   
   {[
     (fun x y -> ...     ) 100 3 
   ]}   
   we can bound [x] to [100] in a single step
